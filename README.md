Summary: Susceptibility to *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI) typically follows the administration of antibiotics. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased incidence of CDI, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment. We recently described a mouse model where colitis triggered by the murine gut bacterium, *Helicobacter hepaticus*, in IL-10-/- mice led to susceptibility to *C. difficile* without antibiotic administration. The current work disentangles the relative contributions of inflammation and gut microbiota in colonization resistance to *C. difficile* in this model. We show that inflammation drives changes in microbiota composition, which leads to CDI susceptibility. Decreasing inflammation with an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody promotes a shift of the microbiota back toward a colonization-resistant state. Transferring microbiota from susceptible and resistant mice to germ-free animals transfers the susceptibility phenotype, supporting the primacy of the microbiota in colonization resistance. These findings shine light on the complex interactions between the host, microbiota and pathogen in CDI.
